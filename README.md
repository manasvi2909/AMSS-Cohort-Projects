# AMSS Cohort Projects

This repository contains my weekly projects from the **Amazon ML Summer School (AMSS) Cohort by Girls Leading Tech**.  
Each week focuses on applying machine learning concepts through hands-on projects.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. AMSSBeginnerWeek1
- **Description:** Project for **Week 1** of the AMSS cohort.  
- **Focus:** Introduction to Python, data manipulation, and basic ML workflows.  
- **Objective:** Build familiarity with Jupyter notebooks, exploratory data analysis, and simple model training.

### 2. Titanic_Survival_Predictor
- **Description:** Project for **Week 2** of the AMSS cohort.  
- **Dataset:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).  
- **Focus:** Classification problem predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.  
- **Objective:** Learn data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

### 3. Wine_Quality_Dataset
- **Description:** Project for **Week 3** of the AMSS cohort.  
- **Dataset:** [Wine Quality Dataset (UCI Repository)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).  
- **Focus:** Classification task predicting wine quality (low vs high) based on physicochemical features.  
- **Objective:** Compare multiple machine learning algorithms, evaluate performance, and interpret results.
